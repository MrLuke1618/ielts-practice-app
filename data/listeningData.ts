We could sleep on the boat. I saw a good deal for a 2-day, 1-night cruise. It includes meals, kayaking, and a visit to a cave.</p><p><b>Minh:</b> Perfect! What's the name of the cave?</p><p><b>Linh:</b> It's called Thien Cung Cave, which means 'Heavenly Palace' cave. It's supposed to be huge and have amazing stalactites.</p><p><b>Minh:</b> Awesome. How much is the cruise per person?</p><p><b>Linh:</b> It's 1,500,000 Vietnamese Dong. I think it's a reasonable price for everything that's included.</p><p><b>Minh:</b> I agree. Let's book it!

First, let's talk about our opening hours. We're open from 8 AM to 10 PM, Monday to Friday. On weekends, Saturday and Sunday, we're open from 10 AM to 6 PM. Please note that the library is closed on public holidays. Now, about borrowing books. All students can borrow up to ten books at a time. The loan period is for two weeks. You can renew your books online through the library website, but only twice. After that, you'll need to bring the books back to the library. If a book is overdue, there is a fine of five thousand Dong per day. The library has three floors. The ground floor has the main desk, computers, and the fiction section. The second floor houses all the non-fiction books, including the science and history collections. The third floor is our silent study area, with individual desks for students who need quiet to concentrate. We hope you enjoy using the library facilities.</p>",
